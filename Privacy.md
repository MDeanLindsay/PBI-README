# Privacy Policy for README

**Effective Date:** 06/22/2025  
**Last Updated:** 07/29/2025

## Overview

The ReadMe visual is designed with your privacy in mind. All markdown rendering and data processing occur entirely within your Power BI environment. In other words: your data stays put. We do not, cannot, and frankly would not want to transmit your data externally.

However, when you acquire this visual through Microsoft AppSource or a supported integration platform, Microsoft, acting as the initial collector, may, with your consent, share certain business-related identifiers (such as your name, email, and company) with us, the publisher, via Partner Center. We neither require nor actively seek this information, but if it arrives, we promise to treat it with the utmost respect.

## Processing

### What the Visual Handles (and Forgets)
- Markdown content from your Power BI data sources
- Formatting settings (fonts, colors, etc.)
- User interactions for Power BI cross-filtering

**All of this stays inside Power BI. We donâ€™t see it, store it, or send it anywhere.**

### What Microsoft Shares (If You Let Them)
If you access our product via AppSource or a supported integration, Microsoft may send us business-related identifiers (like your name, email, and company) in accordance with their policies and your consent.

#### What Might We Do With This Info?
We process this information under the legal basis of either **consent** (as provided through Microsoft AppSource) or **legitimate interest** (in supporting and improving product access and usage).

We use this information solely for:
- Ensuring service continuity and performance
- Providing product updates or technical notices
- Delivering a one-off, friendly hello to and thank you for using the visual (no marketing, ever).
- If appropriate, reaching out to explore potential collaboration opportunities related to Power BI or data vizualizations

Contact details received through AppSource are retained only as long as necessary for these purposes, or until you ask us to delete them.

We do **not** sell or share this information with third parties. You can opt out of future communications at any time using the link in those messages.
